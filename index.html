The uprisings were sparked by college student protests in the border city of San Cristobal in response to increased violence, poverty, and food shortages which they believe attributable to the Venezuelan leadership under the newly elected President Nicolas Maduro. Violence during the San Cristobal protests resulted in the arrest of several students.</p>

They organized demonstrations on February 12 in an effort to persuade the government to release those students arrested in San Cristobal. The Caracas demonstrations turned deadly when three people were shot following a peaceful march.</p>

                                <p>Prior to the 1998 Presidential elections, Venezuela had been run by an exclusive democratic two-party system. The government representatives were from middle and upper class sectors of the country. There was widespread dissatisfaction with the standard of living amongst the lower classes. Hugo Chavez emerged as a socialist reformer who gained the favor of the poor working class and the support of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. He won the 1998 election with over 56% of the vote. Despite insistence by the United States that the voting was inaccurate, Chavez and his progressive socialist regime continued to gain the popular vote in every election through 2012. The standard of living amongst the poor improved with healthcare, job creation and food availability all gained through the leveraging of Venezuela’s rich oil supply.</p>

                           <p>In late 2002-early 2003, attempts were made by Chavez’s opposition to stage an oil strike in an effort to diminish the leader’s popularity. Affluent business owners and managers succeeded in locking workers out of facilities and blocking shipping. The economy was crippled by shortages as a result.  Demands were made for Chavez’s resignation in exchange for calling-off the strike.  Chavez utilized the resources of allies in neighboring countries to circumvent the blockades and shorten the strike.It was later revealed that the strike had been planned, funded and implemented with the assistance of the Administration of the United States government under President George W. Bush.</p>

        <p>There was immediate criticism of naming Nicolas Maduro, then vice president, as the interim president.

                                    <p>Nearly 85% of the Venezuelan population resides in the urban centers of the northern coastal cities of Caracas, Maracay, Maracaibo, San Cristobal and Valencia. Immigration of technically skilled workers from Chile, Argentina and Uruguay was increased in the 1970’s because of the growth of the Venezuelan oil market.  Until that time, non-Hispanic immigration was discouraged. Despite its growing oil trade, the lower class poor lived in record poverty under the democratic political parties. The election of socialist Hugo Chavez in 1998 resulted in a redistribution and control of the oil industry. The once privately-held oil companies became majority owed by the government.  As a result, the government used the substantial production to entice relations with neighboring allies such as Cuba, in exchange for cheap oil. It also promised the Venezuelan citizens access to cheap gas. These combined uses in the essentially single-commodity economy placed Venezuela in position of extreme vulnerability to OPEC pricing. Current president, Nicolar Maduro continues this economic model despite the resultant inflation and trade inequalities that it has produced.</p>

The students expressed their anger over increased crime and deteriorating security under the regimes of both Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro. The police arrested and detained several students. Students from other Venezuelan universities in the capital city of Caracas marched in protest of the arrests a few days later.

In the current economic climate, with the poor and underclass highly representative in the voting populace, Venezuela has placed itself under highly socialistic, Marxist political control.  Efforts by the United States to undermine the regime have been unsuccessful.  As a result, many of the affluent, middle and upper income intelligencia have emigrated out of the country, resulting in a political, social, economic and technological “brain drain.”Previously under the Democratic Party system, the elected president had a 4-year election cycle and a two-term limit.</p>
